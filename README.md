# CarouselLikeTinder
A complete project that dynamically creates a new "div" based on data from JSON. 
It then added each element's innerHTML value to the two arrays.
At the end, it allows you to view the list of approved and rejected elements. It enables saving to pdf or printing.
It does not require any additional packages. It works straight out of the box.
Have fun and enjoy!
